# Python-Learning
This repository is created to demonstrate the python learning journey that I undertake in and show the multiple minor learning projects that I do to demonstrate the python proficiency.
Also this repos also includes all the easy to intermediate level projects that encompass the python projects that I do.
Also the python projects that I upload here might be the same as you find in someone's videos so please do keep in mind that these projects are all for practice and so as these projects may bear a resemblance to someone's code. Pls be nice :)
Thanks and Namaste. :))
